 Welcome, Earthling! 

 I am Ben Luby. I’m a UX designer with a focus on ethical, accessible, and sustainable products and services.

 This site is a work in progress. It’s a great way for me to learn HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript so I can manage things as independently as possible. I’m hoping this will help me work better with developers. 

 Eventually I will be using this site as a blog and portfolio for my work. This might involve [microblog](https://micro.blog/). 
 
 [ben@luby.design](mailto: for suggestions and feedback.

 Welcome! This is the latest About file. 

 I am Ben Luby. I am a UX designer with a focus on ethical, accessibile, and sustainable products and services.

 This site is a work in progress.

 I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript so I can manage things as independently as possible.

I am using:
- [GitHub](github.com) for version control
- [Netlify](netlify.com) for hosting my static site. Free and fast. 
- [Portfolio Starter](https://portfolio-starter.sb-ph.com/) which uses [Eleventy](11ty.dev) for a simple accessible portfolio template to kick start my site
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) for Mac for code. Simpler to learn than say, Visual Code Studio. 
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) github client for iOS. There is a github app but it lacks features like being able to commit. 
- [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writercom/) for iOS. Markdown editing 

Please be patient.

 Eventually I will be using this site as a blog and portfolio for my work. This might involve [microblog](https://micro.blog/). 
 
 But first Iâ€™m exploring how I can do all of this from an iPad. If anyone has any good workflows for updating sites using IA Writer then please let me know via @lubes on Twitter.

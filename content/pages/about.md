Blah blah blah...uhuhuh

 You have arrived at the site of Ben Luby.

 I am a designer with an interest in ethical, accessibile, and sustainable tech.

 This is a work in progress.

 I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript so I can manage my own site.

 I'm also learning how GitHub, Netlify and Atom all work together so please be patient.

 Eventually I will be using this site as a blog and portfolio for my work. But first Iâ€™m exploring how I can all of this from an iPad. If anyone has any good workflows using IA Writer then please let me know via @lubes on Twitter.

Welcome! 

I’m a UX designer with a focus on ethical, accessible, and sustainable products and services.

This portfolio and blog site is a work in progress. It’s a way for me to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I can manage things on my own. I’m hoping this will improve my communication with developers too.

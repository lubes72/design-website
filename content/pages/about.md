 user may not know how to code but is interested in the tech behind their website, is willing to write in Markdown, and is happy to follow a few instructions. The codebase is deliberately basic to encourage tinkering and customisation for everyone, including a beginner that is just beginning to learn why `alt` text is important (hint: it’s really important). Since it uses the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), Portfolio Starter can be hooked up to free static hosting providers such as Netlify or ZEIT Now.

[Check out the documentation](https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-starter) to start experimenting, you can get a website online with the click of a few buttons. If you give it a try, [let us know](mailto:mail@sb-ph.com)! We’d love to see how people use it and where they take it.

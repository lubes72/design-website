 Welcome, Earthling! 

 I am Ben Luby. I’m a UX designer with a focus on ethical, accessibile, and sustainable products and services.

 This site is a work in progress. It’s a great way for me to learn HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript so I can manage things as independently as possible. I’m hoping this will help me work better with developers. 

To publish this site I am using:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control.
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for hosting my static site. Free and fast. 
- [Portfolio Starter](https://portfolio-starter.sb-ph.com/) which uses [Eleventy](11ty.dev) for a simple accessible portfolio template to kick start my site
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) for Mac for code. Simpler to learn than say, Visual Code Studio. 
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) github client for iOS. There is a github app but it lacks features like being able to commit. 
- [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writercom/) is a Markdown editing tool for iOS. 

 Eventually I will be using this site as a blog and portfolio for my work. This might involve [microblog](https://micro.blog/).

To publish this site I am using:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control.
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for hosting my static site. Free and fast. 
- [Portfolio Starter](https://portfolio-starter.sb-ph.com/) which uses [Eleventy](11ty.dev) for a simple accessible portfolio template to kick start my site
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) for Mac for code. Simpler to learn than say, Visual Code Studio. 
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) github client for iOS. There is a github app for iOS but it lacks features like being able to commit. 
- [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writercom/) is a Markdown editing tool for iOS.
